"Aug 14, 2021",Messi exit leaves Dest with 'weird' feeling as USMNT star reacts to shock Barcelona departure,"Sergino Dest says that Lionel Messi's departure from Barcelona left him ""shocked"", with the United States international admitting that life without an Argentine icon at Camp Nou feels ""weird"".
A six-time Ballon d'Or did agree a new contract with Joan Laporta and the Blaugrana board, but financial difficulties in Catalunya prevented paperwork from being signed and an all-time great is now opening a new chapter in his remarkable career with Paris Saint-Germain.
Filling the void left behind will be impossible for Ronaldo Koeman and Co, with Dest conceding that he is still coming to terms with the absence of record-setting superstar.
USMNT defender Dest has told ESPN of seeing Messi depart: ""I was shocked a little bit because everyone wanted him to stay at the club.
""He's the best player in the world. It was a shock for everyone. We wish he could have stayed. Unfortunately, he couldn't.
""We've got some work to do because with Messi it is easier, he's the best player in the world. But I think if we play collectively and keep the chemistry high, we can achieve a lot.
""At the training ground and on the pitch, you see unbelievable things. You see how he scores those goals. What you see on the pitch is the same, even when you're that close. It's unbelievable to see him like that.
""We all have him in our hearts. It's Messi. It just feels weird because he played for so long at this club, almost his whole life, and suddenly he had to leave. But we have to focus on the new season.""
   
The Barcelona boss has spoken on a regular basis since Messi's exit was confirmed about the need for La Liga giants to move on and focus on other areas.
He has added ahead of a season opener against Real Sociedad: ""It’s painful for everyone. Because of what Messi has done at the club. 
""We miss him because of how important he is but we don’t have to live from the past. These are things that happen. I’m excited about the team we have and hopefully we have the support of the fans.""
On whether he could push for another attacker to be added to his ranks with Messi gone and Sergio Aguero injured, Koeman added: ""Seeing all the positions of the team we lack people in front. Ansu [Fati], [Ousmane] Dembele, Aguero are missing.
""We lack there and that is why we have talked about the possibility of signing a forward to have more players and more competition. It all depends on whether we can sign.""

"Aug 19, 2021",Pochettino pressed on Messi debut & Mbappe future ahead of PSG's meeting with Brest,"Mauricio Pochettino is giving little away when it comes to his plans for Lionel Messi, with the Argentine in line to make his Paris Saint-Germain against Brest, but the coach is confident that Kylian Mbappe will remain part of his plans this season.
The Ligue 1 heavyweights now boast an enviable array of attacking talent on their books, with six-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi being slotted into a star-studded squad alongside the likes of Neymar, Angel Di Maria and Mauro Icardi.
It could be that Messi, who was snapped up as a free agent once no contract was signed at Barcelona, opens a new chapter in his career on Friday, with another positive week of training put in following his arrival in France.
Quizzed on whether Messi is part of his plans for a meeting with Brest, Pochettino told reporters: ""We have not yet communicated plans to the group, we will analyse and decide after the conference. 
""We all know his qualities, he brings a very positive energy. The connection was made quickly. You can tell there's a good feeling, and not only in the dressing room but also on the pitch.""
   
PSG, without Messi and Neymar, looked to Mbappe for inspiration in their last outing against Strasbourg, as he caught the eye in a 4-2 win.
Speculation regarding the 22-year-old's future has continued to rage since then, as he plays out the final year of his contract, but Pochettino is adamant that a prized asset is going nowhere.
He added on the Real Madrid-linked superstar: ""Kylian, I see him being very well. He's working really hard to be ready this season. And I see him staying with us this season. 
""We also know that during these periods, a lot of things are said. Some things happen, others don't. I see Kylian working well, he's got his head in tomorrow's game. He is focused.""
PSG have invested heavily in lucrative contracts this summer for Messi, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Georginio Wijnaldum and Sergio Ramos, but have only paid out a transfer fee for Achraf Hakimi.
There could still be more business to come at Parc des Princes, amid links to the likes of Paul Pogba and Eduardo Camavinga, with Pochettino conceding that the arrivals lounge remains open.
The Argentine added: ""We know that in football there can be surprises. We remain attentive. 
""If I had a wish, I wouldn't say it publicly, but I would go and see Leonardo first. If I gave this information, it would cause problems.""

"Aug 19, 2021",Messi & Neymar left out of PSG's squad for Ligue 1 clash with Brest,"Goal can confirm that Lionel Messi and Neymar have been left out of Mauricio Pochettino's Paris Saint-Germain squad for their Ligue 1 clash with Brest on Friday.
Pochettino has already privately communicated who will be involved at Stade Francis-Le Ble, with Messi missing the cut due to the fact he is still getting up to speed after his summer holidays.
The Argentine, who joined PSG on a free transfer following his surprise exit from Barcelona at the start of the month, will be joined on the sidelines by ex-Blaugrana teammate Neymar and Leandro Paredes, both of whom have also only just returned to full training.
PSG supporters will now have to wait a bit longer before seeing Messi in action, with PSG not due back in action again until August 29 away at Reims.
The six-time Ballon d'Or winner will almost certainly be ready to play a part in that fixture, having already started full training with the rest of the squad, but will likely head off for Argentina duty again thereafter as the first international break of the season comes into effect.
Messi, who helped his country win the Copa America in July, originally agreed to sign a new contract at Barca after becoming a free agent, but they were forced to announce his departure after a trophy-laden 21-year career at Camp Nou due to their ongoing financial struggles.
The 34-year-old was then snapped up by PSG on a two-year contract, and he will be expected to help them fight for silverware on both domestic and European fronts when he returns to full fitness.
Goal understands that Pochettino will name a similar squad to the one for PSG's 4-2 victory over Strasbourg last weekend, with the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Mauro Icardi and Archaf Hakimi all set to feature again.
However, the Parisian outfit will be even stronger this time around as Angel Di Maria, Marco Verratti and Marquinhos come back into the fold, and Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma will be in line for his first appearance since joining the club ahead of Keylor Navas.
PSG can go three points clear at the top of Ligue 1 with a second successive win as Pochettino seeks to bring the title back to Parc des Princes following their surprise loss in last season's title race to Lille.

"Aug 17, 2021",Video: Mbappe assists Messi goal in PSG training to give mouth-watering glimpse of what's to come,"Paris Saint-Germain have released a clip of Kylian Mbappe assisting Lionel Messi in training to give fans a mouth-watering glimpse of what's to come this season.
Barcelona announced that they could not re-sign Messi at the start of August  amid an ongoing financial crisis at Camp Nou, with  PSG subsequently swooping in and securing his services on a free transfer. 
The Argentine officially signed a two-year deal at Parc des Princes last week, and has already started training with his new team-mates, including Mbappe, who has been strongly linked with a move to Real Madrid in recent months.

PSG are hopeful that Mbappe will ignore Real's advances in favour of extending his stay in Paris beyond 2022 following Messi's arrival, and the pair have seemingly already struck up a good relationship on the training pitch.
The French giants have posted a video on their social media channels showing Mbappe setting up his new team-mate to score in a practice drill.
The 22-year-old can be seen performing a step over to get past a defender before playing in Messi, who takes the ball in his stride before finishing calmly past the goalkeeper.
Messi has only just started building his fitness back up after returning from his summer holidays, having helped Argentina lift the Copa America in Brazil earlier this summer.
The 34-year-old missed PSG's 4-2 win over Strasbourg at the weekend as a result,  but was unveiled to the Parc des Princes crowd before the game  and could be in line to feature when they  take in a trip to Brest for their next Ligue 1 outing on August 20. 
Head coach Mauricio Pochettino has said of when Messi is likely to take his bow: ""The idea is to see how he feels so he can make his debut.
""Everyone has seen it, the last few days Leo has had an amazing reception. He is a special boy and we are a staff that listens to the players and we are going to talk to him to find out what he needs and when he will be ready.""

"Aug 18, 2021","Trapped in Turin? Ronaldo set to stay at Juventus after Man City, Madrid and PSG links come to nothing","With Paris Saint-Germain having signed Lionel Messi, Lille's hopes of retaining their Ligue 1 title have taken quite the blow.
So, Jose Fonte has been texting Cristiano Ronaldo every day, begging his fellow Portuguese to join him at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy.
""He just answers 'ha ha ha',"" the defender told Talksport.
Ronaldo, though, doesn't find press speculation about his future quite so funny.
On Tuesday evening, he took to Instagram to express his displeasure with the latest rumours linking him with a move to Real Madrid.
""As well as this most recent episode in Spain, there have been frequent news and stories associating me with a number of clubs in many different leagues, with nobody ever being concerned about trying to find out the actual truth,"" Ronaldo wrote.
""I’m breaking my silence now to say that I can’t allow people to keep playing around with my name. I remain focused on my career and in my work, committed and prepared for all the challenges that I have to face.
""Everything else? Everything else is just talk.""
And that's a fair point. As always with Ronaldo, actions speak louder than words. He often responds to perceived slights in the best way possible: by scoring more and more goals.
The problem here, though, is that in seemingly trying to quash the speculation, he's only added to it.
Ronaldo may have stated unequivocally that his ""story at Real Madrid has been written"", effectively ruling out a return to the Santiago Bernabeu, but he didn't confirm he would be staying at Juventus.
In fact, he didn't mention Juventus at all. Not once. And in what was a rather lengthy statement.
   
Such an oversight was always going to be noticed by concerned fans and pounced upon by the press.
And Ronaldo and his entourage would have known that. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner is, as Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri says, ""a smart guy"". He always knows exactly what he's doing and what he wants.
So, it's difficult not to conclude that the door has been deliberately left ajar. Of course, that doesn't mean that Ronaldo will be able to leave.
He may be the greatest goalscorer in the history of the game but he is by no means a man in demand. The few clubs that could afford him all have other priorities.
Madrid have long dreamed of signing Kylian Mbappe, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City are doing their utmost to persuade Tottenham to part company with Harry Kane, while PSG have already snapped up Messi.
In the current economic climate, what other club would be willing, or indeed capable, of paying the €30m (£25/$34m) fee Juve need to avoid making a capital loss on Ronaldo, while at same time matching his current net salary of €31m (£26m/$36m)?
It, thus, seems inevitable that Ronaldo will have no other option but to see out the final year of his Juventus contract, and it would hardly be the end of the world for him.
The return of Massimiliano Allegri as coach is certainly a boost for the Bianconeri, who have gone backwards since his departure in 2019, and Ronaldo is likely to line up alongside Paulo Dybala and Federico Chiesa in an exciting-looking attack.
Juve have also signed Manuel Locatelli from Sassuolo and the dynamic but impressively composed Italy international should significantly strengthen the team's weakest department, the midfield.
   
However, while the Old Lady looks well placed to reclaim her Serie A crown after last season's dismal fourth-placed finish, it would be a surprise if they immediately re-emerged as Champions League challengers under Allegri.
The expectation is that it will take time for the coach to complete the overhaul he wanted to implement before being forced out in 2019.
And time is a precious commodity as far as Ronaldo is concerned.
He remains a goalscoring machine and an impressive physical specimen but he is 36 now and knows that he will not get many more chances to win the Champions League, or the Ballon d'Or for that matter.
He wants and needs to be playing in a winning team now, which, ironically, given all of their differences, is precisely why his great rival Messi chose to join PSG, a club perfectly primed for another assault on the European Cup.
Indeed, it's easy to understand why Angel Di Maria believes his former Madrid team-mate would jump at the chance to move to the Parc des Princes.
""Cristiano Ronaldo would be dying to be here,” the Argentine told TyC Sports. “The quality and quantity of players at PSG is something unique.
""It doesn’t happen often in clubs and the greats always want to be with the best. Cristiano would certainly like to be here, but they signed Messi, and luckily, it’s better this way.""
Not for Ronaldo, of course. 
   
According to La Repubblica, his agent Jorge Mendes has been trying to secure his client a transfer to Paris for two years, so seeing Messi arrive just two days after suddenly quitting Barcelona must have stung.
The Corriere dello Sport has since claimed that Mendes is now offering Ronaldo to City as an alternative to Kane, but again, such a move makes as much sense as Madrid suddenly giving up on Mbappe, who will be a free agent in a year, in order to re-sign their all-time record goalscorer.
Stranger things have happened in football, of course. This year alone has been utterly absurd and there has been talk of Ronaldo joining PSG if Mbappe moves to Madrid. 
Right now, though, that is ""just talk"", as Ronaldo put it. As things stand, it seems that Ronaldo has no other option but to stay at Juventus. 
""I think that what's primarily been lacking up until now are offers,"" Sportitalia TV's renowned transfer market expert Ginaluigi Longari tells Goal.
""It's clear that Juventus can't post a loss on Ronaldo, given how much they've paid for him, and continue to pay him.
""So, it's a very complicated transfer to bring to a conclusion. 
""Jorge Mendes has certainly spoken with several other clubs but in none of those cases did a concrete offer arrive to either Juve or the player.
""Obviously, losing Ronaldo would hurt from a sporting and commercial perspective, it's also true that removing his salary from the wage bill would allow Juventus to invest in other elements to start a new cycle under Allegri.
""But I think that Ronaldo will stay at Juventus until the close of the transfer window, also because trying to replace a player like him in just 10 days would be almost impossible.""
Essentially, there really isn't anywhere else for him to go.
Ronaldo looks trapped in Turin."
"Aug 18, 2021",Kroos drops Mbappe to Real Madrid transfer hint & discusses Messi exit weakening Barcelona,"Toni Kroos has dropped a Kylian Mbappe to Real Madrid transfer hint while discussing Lionel Messi's Barcelona exit potentially weakening his club's main rivals.
Messi's 21-year career at Camp Nou officially came to an end at the start of the month when Barca announced that they were unable to re-sign the 34-year-old due to their ongoing struggle to get below La Liga's current wage limit.
PSG subsequently swooped in to sign Messi on a free transfer, but it has been suggested that they could lose another star name in the form of Mbappe, who has yet to reach an agreement with the club over a contract extension.
Kroos can now see Mbappe making his way to Real Madrid, with it his belief that Messi's move to Parc des Princes could end up working in the Blancos' favour in a number of different ways.
""We'll see how it all works out (Messi to PSG). Maybe the move is good for us because our biggest competitor has lost their best player,"" the Germany international said while talking to his brother on their joint podcast Einfach mal luppen.
""And maybe even more good things will come out of it as a result. Maybe [a player] from Paris joins us… If that (Mbappe joining Madrid) should actually happen - I don't know - this whole Messi deal would certainly not be a disadvantage for us.""
Mbappe has just entered the final year of his contract at PSG, and Goal has reported that Real will wait until next summer before swooping for his signature if a deal cannot be arranged before the end of the current transfer window.
However, Parc des Princes president Nasser Al-Khelaifi made it clear that he expects the World Cup winner to stay put after Messi's unveiling in Paris last week.
""The future of Mbappe? I think everyone knows. His future is clear. He said it himself, he wanted us to have a competitive team,"" he said. ""Well, we have the most competitive in the world right now. So there is no excuse for him now. He can't do anything else but stay.""
Kroos went on to weigh in on the eternal debate over who is the greatest player of all time, choosing his former Real team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo, who now plays for Juventus, over Barcelona's all-time record goalscorer Messi.
""From my playing days, it's Cristiano Ronaldo (best player of all time),"" said the Blancos star. ""Of course I'm biased because he made a decisive contribution to us winning a lot of titles. It was exciting and impressive (to play alongside Ronaldo).
""We were not only team-mates, but also neighbours in the dressing room and neighbours in private. He lived right next to me. Seeing what a perfectionist he is was impressive.
""That is why it is forbidden for me to name Messi (as the best player of all time).""

"Aug 20, 2021",'I couldn’t even say hello to him' - Depay missed Messi at Barcelona but is enjoying working with Dest,"Memphis Depay ""couldn't even say hello"" to Lionel Messi following his arrival at Barcelona with the Argentine icon heading out of Camp Nou, but the Dutch forward is enjoying life alongside Gerard Pique and Sergino Dest.
The Netherlands international completed a switch to Catalunya over the summer having reached the end of his contract at Lyon, but experienced a sliding doors moment with the Argentine icon that also found himself a free agent.
With Depay on Euro 2020 duty and Messi away winning the Copa America, the pair never crossed paths before taking on new challenges with Barca and Paris Saint-Germain respectively.
Depay told El Periodico of missing Messi but reuniting with former Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman: ""I didn’t even get to know [Messi]. He came late to pre-season because of the break after the Copa America and I couldn’t even say hello to him. 
""I know what [Koeman] wants from me. I know what I have to do, there’s a chemistry between us. That’s very important.""
   
The familiar face of fellow countryman Koeman has helped Depay to settle quickly at Camp Nou, with international team-mate Frenkie de Jong another he can look to for advice.
Long-serving defender Pique has also helped the summer signing to find his feet, while USMNT star Dest is aiding the adjustment period for the former PSV and Manchester United star.
Depay said: ""Everyone has been very nice and they have made it easy for me. Pique has helped me a lot because his English is good. With [Jordi] Alba I also have a lot of fun. Of course, Frenkie and Dest also, because I already knew them. It’s a nice dressing room.""
Depay caught the eye with some impressive showings during pre-season, with that form carried over into a season-opening 4-2 win over Real Sociedad in which he provided the assist for Pique's deadlock-breaking goal.
On what he can offer to Barca, Depay said: ""I try to give something extra on the pitch, something important for the team, to bring joy to the game. That’s why the connection with the fans is incredible. It makes me feel fantastic and I hope it continues. I’ll give everything on the pitch for them to enjoy.""
Barca will be back in action on Saturday at Athletic Club.

"Aug 16, 2021",Jordi Alba responds to Messi blame claims and accusations of snubbing Barcelona pay cut,"Jordi Alba has hit back at claims he was partly to blame for Lionel Messi leaving Barcelona this summer, with the long-serving full-back refuting accusations of snubbing a pay cut.
Financial struggles at Camp Nou have dominated headlines over recent months, with debts preventing the Liga giants from doing business many expected to be completed.
They were unable to get a new contract in place with six-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi, leading to him joining Paris Saint-Germain as a free agent with cost-cutting exercises not coming quickly enough to allow salary cap demands to be met.
Blame has been pointed in various directions on the back of Messi's departure, but Alba - who boasted a strong bond with the Argentine on and off the field - insists he is being unfairly singled out.
The Spain international defender told reporters after the 4-2 win over Real Sociedad for a new-look Barca side: ""Apart from being the best ever, Leo was the one who understood me best, so imagine the efforts I would have made for him to stay.
""It's not true [that Messi left because of a pay cut the captains rejected]. The Messi stuff was separate from the captains, between he club and him.
""I can't control everything that's said, but I've been around. Nothing will surprise me. If 10 out of 10 news articles about Jordi Alba are negative, it's normal that people think badly. I can't stand being doubted.""
   
Barca are still working on getting their house in order, with Gerard Pique confirming that the four captains within the club's squad will take pay cuts.
That group includes Alba, who insists that he never turned down those demands earlier in the summer because no discussions were held.
The 32-year-old added: """"When the club talks with me, I am willing. I'm from here, spending my whole life in Barcelona. That my commitment is questioned hurts me a lot. As the president hasn't spoken specifically about this yet, I suppose he will speak and he'll tell the truth.""
Alba added: ""My lawyers have spoken to the club. Pique's was concluded first simply because of the timing but the willingness of all the captains was always as it had to be.
""The lies annoy me, they tire me. I can put up with a lot, but I suffer for my family and the things they have to hear.""

And the hit Netflix series, The Last Dance, which followed the career of Michael Jordan in U.S. basketball, reminded him of his international team-mate's abilities.
""To play against Messi is a nightmare sometimes,"" Caballero told Goal. ""Your team will be focusing on Messi and he creates space for other people then eventually the next person to appear is Messi.
""I had the opportunity to train with him in a small game in the national team. He is a machine, even when he trains, he just wants to win. If you have seen The Last Dance with Michael Jordan, he is like that as he cannot accept losing.
""He doesn’t accept losing any single game so he is pushing you to win even a small game. I remember one day when we were training before the World Cup against Spain Under-23s.

""In the build-up, he came to me to offer me a solution. I gave him the ball in our box and he ran with the ball at speed against 10 players and scored. Everyone was thinking, ‘what?!’ We saw Messi in the best level possible before the World Cup.
""We were in shock and it was incredible. Sometimes you don’t see that as teams are really focused on Messi and putting four or five players against him. It is incredible. He is the best player in the world for sure.""
The 34-year-old's transfer to Paris Saint-Germain stunned the world after Barcelona announced that they could no longer afford to keep him. PSG moved to secure him on a free transfer that saw fans partying in the streets.
Caballero watched the situation unfold and felt a sense of empathy as Messi cried in his press conference after leaving Barcelona.
""Now I can see that he is very happy but the days before were really tough,"" he added.
""Everyone was thinking about the next move of Messi but no one was thinking about how he thought when he got the news when Barcelona couldn’t offer what they were going to pay, which was half the price of what he earned last season or something like that.
""There’s also [Sergio] Kun Aguero as they are really close friends who played in the national team and they wanted to play in the same team again. I believe this news shocked a lot of people in Barcelona.
""I felt sorry for him and his family too. Still, it is good for Leo to try a new league. It is good to show that he can still do it and do what he has done in Barcelona.""

The former Barcelona forward brought the curtain down on a glittering Camp Nou career in particularly wounded circumstances earlier this year following the club's inabiility to re-sign him.
Now, the attacker, who has headlined an influx of major talents at Parc des Princes this summer, is fast approaching a maiden match in their colours, according to his manager.
""It's been a very good week for Leo,"" Pochettino told ESPN Argentina, after his side's 4-2 win over Brest on Friday.
""Next week will be a long one, but if all goes well, we hope he can be in the squad and start at a competitive level [against Reims].""
Pochettino also confirmed that the club would not stand in Messi's way if he elects to link up with the Argentina national team ahead of their Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifiers next month.
""I have not yet spoken with the selectors,"" he added. ""But they know that I am pro-selection and that we are to help not only Argentina, but all those nations which involve our players.""
The lure of playing under a fellow countryman is thought to have helped swing Messi towards PSG following his Barca exit, and the 34-year-old will be hopeful to feature in some capacity against Reims.
Having not played since he led Argentina to Copa America glory - his first major senior honour for his country - during the international off-season, he will be hoping to pick up minutes ahead of matches with Venezuela and Bolivia.

The exit of the prolific forward after a glittering, near-two-decade career at Camp Nou, has left a major void to fill for the Catalan club this term.
An opening win in La Liga against Real Sociedad has since given way to a frustrating draw with Athletic Club - and speaking after his side were held to a stalemate, Koeman has acknowledged that without their former talisman, they have lost a major psychological edge.
“I don't like to always talk about the same thing, but we're talking about the best in the world,"" the Dutchman told his post-match press conference.
""Our opponents were more scared when Messi was here.
""For us as well, if you pass the ball to Leo, usually he won't lose it. You can tell [Messi] isn't there. We know that and we can't change it.""
Memphis Depay snatched his first goal for Barcelona and rescued a point after Inigo Martinez's opener had put the hosts in front at San Mames, while Eric Garcia was sent off in injury time.
Koeman admitted that he had no quibbles with the result in the end, paying credit to his side's opponents, stating: ""It was a great game for many things in football.
""I think we made things too difficult for ourselves at the start of the game. We need to know when we can play short, from the keeper as well. We weren't calm enough in the first 15 minutes.
""I think a draw is a fair result, we had chances to win, Athletic were at a very high level. Playing like that, this is a very tough ground, so I can't be unhappy with the result.""
As Barcelona continue to mull their post-Messi future, the Argentine is edging closer to a debut for new club Paris Saint-Germain.
Having missed their Ligue 1 openers, the 34-year-old could be in line to feature against Reims at the end of the month.
Messi will hope to get crucial minutes under his belt ahead of a likely return to the Argentina fold for their Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifiers, following his Copa America success last month.

Messi turned the football world upside down this week when he left Barcelona after 21 years to join Neymar and Co. in the French capital. 
And while he is not quite ready to take the pitch for PSG, he has already made a big impression on his new supporters. 
Messi joined Sergio Ramos, Georginio Wijnaldum, Achraf Hakimi and Gianluigi Donnarumma on the field on Saturday for their official presentation to the Parc des Princes faithful. 
The five summer signings were paraded around the stadium prior to PSG's Ligue 1 clash with Strasbourg, with Leo unsurprisingly receiving a huge ovation.

""It has been a very special week, I want to thank everybody for their welcome,"" he said on the Parc des Princes turf after that introduction. 
""It was incredible, I feel so happy, hopeful and delighted to be experiencing this new stage. I hope we can enjoy this year."" 
Saturday's clash is PSG's second of the 2021-22 season, having kicked off their campaign last weekend with a 2-1 defeat of Troyes. 
Messi will play no part in the clash, having spent much of the summer on international duty with Argentina in the World Cup qualifiers and their triumphant Copa America campaign, followed by an extended holiday period while those ultimately doomed contract extensions with Barcelona continued. 
Indeed, just two of that quintet, Hakimi and Wijnaldum, have been included in Mauricio Pochettino's squad, with the former marking his PSG debut with a goal last week. 
""When will we see Leo? This is his second day of training and it's been a month since he played his last game, the Copa America final,"" Pochettino signalled in a press conference on Friday.

The Argentine has presided over a flurry of fresh arrivals in the French capital following last term's dethronement as Ligue 1 champions by Lille, with Georginio Wijnaldum, Achraf Hakimi, Sergio Ramos and Gianluigi Donnarumma having led the new arrivals.
The capture of Lionel Messi earlier this month has dwarfed all other off-season business but with the introduction of such headline talent comes the balancing act of allowing them all to thrive - and Pochettino has acknowledged that the process ""will take time"" to perfect.
""We are at the start of the season, we can see how difficult it is for all the teams to win a game,"" the Argentine told his post-match press conference following his side's 4-2 victory over Brest on Friday.
""There are things to improve. In defence, we have to prevent the transition play which can hurt us. I'm very happy to take three points on difficult ground, against a team that has started the season well. 
“We have a lot of names of players that shine, but we have to build a team, that's the challenge. It won't be easy, we have to find a balance between the talents that we have. It will take time.""
Despite the fact they have already notched up double figures in terms of goals scored across their opening three Ligue 1 wins this term, PSG have also conceded five times, a figure that no other side inside the top half of the table can match.
That Pochettino is yet to solve their defensive fragilities remains an issue, one further acknowledged by Presnel Kimpembe post-match, with the centre-back sporting the captain's armband in victory against Brest.
""We know that we were playing an away game against a team not easy to play,"" the France international told Amazon Prime Video. ""The team is not yet complete, we still have links to create. There are new players, we have to adapt.""
Despite those concerns, PSG are yet to integrate a host of new faces, with Messi, Ramos and Donnarumma all still awaiting their debut for the club.
While Pochettino may face headaches in figuring out how to put them to good use within a single XI, their match-winning properties will still be key assets to the Parisians as they chase domestic and European glory.
Messi could well feature in the club's final game before the September international break, when PSG face Reims on August 29.

"Aug 14, 2021",'We didn't have the slightest chance' - Simeone insists Atletico did not make Messi approach,"Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone has denied reports that the club were in the running to sign Lionel Messi, admitting that they never had a hope of landing El Cholo's compatriot from Barcelona. 
While Messi has been reunited with one-third of the famous MSN partnership at Paris Saint-Germain in Neymar, there was speculation that Luis Suarez could be the one lining up alongside him for the 2021-22 season. 
Simeone, though, poured cold water on those rumours and affirmed there was no contact between his employers and the Argentina ace. 
""You can see that Barcelona's situation caused this exit and that it was huge for our league because of the standing Messi has in La Liga and in Barcelona,"" Simeone explained to reporters in a press conference held on Saturday. 
""It is clear that we were not talking to him and did not have the slightest chance of taking him. 
La Liga is now without both Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, two figures that have symbolised the Spanish top flight over the last decade and a half. 
Simeone, though, believes there is life after the megastars, pointing to the Premier League to show that the world does not have to stop just because the perennial Ballon d'Or contenders are elsewhere. 
""I understand that in the English league Messi and Ronaldo are not there either and it is one of the biggest leagues in the world,"" he added. 
""It will be every team's competitiveness and growth, without Messi and Ronaldo, that makes this a competitive league, just like in England which has neither of the pair.""
Atletico celebrated last season as they clinched the Liga title, the second in Simeone's 10-year stint at the Colchonero helm. 
Simeone was nevertheless typically blunt as he refused to look ahead to the prospect of repeating that feat in 2021-22. 
""We will not change our approach, which is to take things one game at a time, to see what path the league takes,"" he said.
""There is no better way to compete than how we have been doing for the last nine and a half years.""

Messi to PSG: How stunning transfer happened

"Aug 12, 2021",Will Messi and PSG win the Champions League? Check out Goal's Shop Window Transfer Show,
"Aug 22, 2021",Bayern Munich president baffled as to how PSG's wage bill adheres to Financial Fair Play,"Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer has admitted that he is ""still trying to understand"" just how Paris Saint-Germain have managed to fit their summer spending inside Financial Fair Play rules.
The Ligue 1 giants have enjoyed a superstar shopping spree over the transfer window, with Lionel Messi, Sergio Ramos and Gianluigi Donnarumma among the new faces at Parc des Princes.
While PSG have managed to secure the majority of them on free transfers, Hainer has now questioned just how the Qatar-backed club have balanced the wage bill amid FFP restrictions.
""I'm still trying to understand how that goes along with financial fair play,"" the 67-year-old told SportBild's Bayern Insider podcast.
""As PSG is currently upgrading, we will take a very close look at how that can be reconciled with UEFA rules. We stick to it, then we expect other clubs to do the same.
""I'm not too quick to judge Paris, but the purchasing policy is already huge. It's not the transfer fees, it's the salaries.
""When I hear that Messi earns €40 million (£34m/$47m) net, that's €80m (£69m/$94m) gross. In addition, [Achraf] Hakimi, Ramos, Donnarumma - a lot comes together.""
While Bayern have not splashed the cash in the transfer window themselves, there has still been change at the club, with Hansi Flick having been succeeded by Julian Nagelsmann as head coach.
The ex-RB Leipzig boss has taken the reins at Allianz Arena and claimed his first piece of silverware with a DFL-Supercup triumph earlier this month.
An opening Bundesliga draw with Borussia Monchengladbach has, however, made for a less-than-auspicious league start, but Hainer has backed the 34-year-old to remain for years to come.
""We have our dream successor,"" the chairman stated, adding that Nagelsmann would ""definitely"" remain for the duration of his five-year contract with the Bavarian giants.

"Aug 11, 2021","BBC, MSN and now MNM: Where does Messi, Neymar, Mbappe rank in the history of football’s finest front threes?","Marco Verratti has never hidden his excitement at the idea of playing in the same side as Lionel Messi.
As recently as February, when the full extent of Barcelona's financial crisis was starting to become clear, the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder was asked by Canal Plus about the prospect of the Argentina attacker swapping Camp Nou for the Parc des Princes.
“To have him in the squad would be something magnificent,"" Verratti gushed. “I would give the ball to Neymar and Messi and stay behind to just enjoy watching them a bit.""
That dream is now set to become a reality, with PSG having confirmed the signing of the Argentina captain on a free transfer on Tuesday evening.
It is, of course, impossible not to ask how the Parisiens have pulled this off? 
In the same summer that they have signed Achraf Hakimi from Inter for an initial €60 million (£51m/$70m), and handed out massive contracts to the most in-demand free agents on the market – Sergio Ramos, Gigio Donnarumma and Gini Wijnaldum – PSG have now given Messi a net salary of €35m (£30m/$41m) a season.
This is made all the more extraordinary for two reasons: they already have the two most expensive players in history, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, on their wage bill; and the world remains gripped by the devastating economic effects of a pandemic.
Football fans already disgusted by a lack of competition in Europe's elite leagues, the recent concentration of talent at clubs funded by oil money, and the Super League threat to the very existence of innumerable clubs across the continent, are understandably wondering where 'Financial Fair Play' is in all of this.
PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi insists everything has been done by the book, but their summer spending spree surely shows that if UEFA's flawed but essential bid to control spending was not dead before, it is now.
Still, there is absolutely no denying that many football fans will be able to put all of these grave and legitimate concerns to one side and look forward to the prospect of Messi teaming up with Neymar and Mbappe. 
Such is the nature of the modern football follower.
   
As former PSG winger Ludovic Giuly enthused in Le Parisien, ""We already had two of the four best players in the world. Now we have the third! 
""Do you realise that Neymar, Messi and Mbappe will play together in Ligue 1? It sounds mind-boggling!""
And it is: PSG are now in a position to field what could prove the greatest attacking trio in football history.
Neymar's outrageous trickery and Mbappe's searing pace are now set to be complemented by Messi's otherworldly genius – their potential is frightening.
Indeed, we could be about to see a repeat of what Messi and Neymar achieved alongside Luis Suarez in Barcelona's famed 'MSN' attack: a spectacular Champions League triumph in the South Americans' first season together.
Not that having such a talented forward line is a guarantee of success, of course. 
As Gerard Pique admitted, Barca were made ""to suffer"" in the 2015 Champions League final win over Juventus, and that was with some of the finest midfielders of all time within their ranks.
However, the defender tellingly added, ""It's easier with three players up front with such quality and who are so fast. You give them the ball and they just create goal opportunities.""
Messi is no longer quite so fast, of course. At 34, he is clearly slowing down. But as well as scoring more goals than any other player in La Liga last season (30), he also completed the most dribbles (159) and created the most chances (77). 
He remains a phenomenon, as he proved again during the off-season by leading Argentina to Copa America glory, and the target now, as he openly admitted in Wednesday's press unveiling, is a fifth Champions League crown. 
   
PSG were clearly only one of a select few clubs capable of meeting Messi's exorbitant wage demands, but they also offered him his best shot at more European glory. And that will be the minimum expected of the newly christened 'MNM' forward line this season.
It is also imperative if they are to be compared to the game's great trios.
Remember, Real Madrid's 'BBC' forward line of Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo combined to win four Champions Leagues, including a historic three in a row.
And yet, for some Blancos supporters, the club's greatest attacking triumvirate remains Alfredo Di Stefano, Ferenc Puskas and Paco Gento – who claimed five consecutive European Cups in a row between 1956 and 1960.
Of course, such sustained success already appears beyond Messi, Neymar and Mbappe.
Because of the Argentine's age, and the Frenchman's expiring contract, it is highly doubtful that we will eventually see a statue in the mould of George Best, Dennis Law and Bobby Charlton erected outside the Parc des Princes in honour of 'MNM'.
We may be about to bear witness to the most expensively assembled attack in football history, but it's certainly not been built to last. It could well be broken up inside a year.
Still, while the 'MNM' era might be short-lived, it should prove spectacular.
No matter where one stands on the PSG project, just like Verratti, we are all highly likely to enjoy watching them play, even if it is just for a bit..."
"Aug 10, 2021",Don’t look back in anger: Why Man City have no regrets about missing out on Messi,"There was always a feeling at Manchester City that if Lionel Messi ever left Barcelona, he would end up at the Etihad Stadium.
Other than the weather, everything was in place for him to find a slice of his beloved Catalunya in Manchester: a squad to match his ambition, a salary to equal his expectations and, crucially, a coach that had previously extracted the very best out of his unique talent.
There was even the allure of a less pressurised environment, the kind that allows Pep Guardiola to go for dinner at his city centre restaurant without being pestered by supporters.
Yet when Messi’s Barca departure was put beyond all doubt during a tearful press conference, City were no longer interested in signing the six-time Ballon d’Or winner.
Such an astonishing development could have thrown City’s summer transfer plans into chaos, but rather than scrambling to put a package together for Messi, they moved forward with plans to seal a £100 million British-record deal for Jack Grealish with the prospect of at least one more major deal to follow.
The No.10 shirt, vacated by Sergio Aguero following his move in the opposite direction to Camp Nou, was handed to Grealish – even to the England international’s surprise – with no suggestion of holding it back for anyone else.
City had moved on from building their dream around the ultimate superstar signing and were sticking to the carefully laid plans they had in place for this summer.
“We were convinced by Grealish and convinced Leo would stay at Barca,” Guardiola told his first news conference of the season. “Right now, he is not in our thoughts.”
   
Just a year ago, it was a completely different story. Messi wanted to leave Barca and believing it could happen, City were at the front of the queue for his signature.
But the Argentine revealed in an earth-shattering interview with Goal that despite feeling betrayed by then-Blaugrana president Josep Maria Bartomeu, he was going to stay at Camp Nou because of his unwillingness to become embroiled in a legal dispute with the club he joined as a 13-year-old.
This time around, Messi wanted to stay and was shocked when a deal could not be agreed because of Barca's financial problems, prompting the sudden search for a new club. Paris Saint-Germain moved quickly but without competition from England.
Heading into the winter of 2020, City had contemplated a move for the 34-year-old, with his future uncertain as his controversial contract moved into its final six months.
Presidential elections changed the landscape at Barca, with Joan Laporta, who was in charge for the most successful period in the club’s history, voted in by club members, generating fresh hope among the fans and the players.
Notably, Messi cast his own vote – a gesture that suggested he would stay at the club if his preferred candidate won.
At that point, City’s hierarchy, including former Barca executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain, were no longer in any doubt that Messi would finish his top-level career in Catalunya, particularly with no encouragement coming from Messi’s circle.
With a significant summer ahead, they decided to switch from being his fall-back option to concentrate on other transfer targets.
Aguero, the club’s greatest ever goalscorer, had announced at the end of March that he would be leaving the club after a decade of stellar service.
Although Aguero's last season was wrecked by injury and illness setbacks, replacing the forward was made the club's top priority. And City knew it wouldn't be easy.
   
Aguero had scored 23 or more goals in eight of the previous nine seasons and while City survived and flourished by playing with a false nine during last season's Premier League title triumph, their goal tally was the lowest since Guardiola’s first year in charge at the club.
The worry now is that the window will close without City having successfully brought in a world-class centre-forward to lead the line in 2021-22.
Erling Haaland was a target until Borussia Dortmund ruled out doing business unless they were given an extraordinary fee, while trying to prize Harry Kane away from Tottenham is proving unsurprisingly difficult.
Yet, despite City's struggles, they never seriously entertained the idea of signing Messi to add goals to their attack.
Guardiola wanted Grealish before the end of last season and, after adding the former Aston Villa man to a squad that already included a plethora of technically gifted players such as Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden, Ilkay Gundogan and Raheem Sterling, it was felt that Messi's skills were no longer required.
A centre-forward who can score 30 goals and lead the line was paramount. Messi may still be the world's most talented footballer at 34 but he is not what's required right now.
Guardiola is building for the future, with Grealish and Foden ready to become superstars, while the peerless playmaker De Bruyne remains determined to inspire City to Champions League glory. 
Chief executive Soriano had said they would “open the doors wide” if Messi came available in 2016 but, in the end, they stayed shut when the Argentine's arrival actually became a possibility.
Messi was always a dream signing for City but the timing was simply never right for it to become a reality."
"Aug 12, 2021","With Messi moving to France, the Bundesliga needs Haaland to be their superstar","One of the things that annoyed football fans the most about the proposed European Super League (ESL) was the term 'legacy fans'.
These are traditional supporters of clubs who care about a team's history, unlike 'fans of the future', who follow superstar names and would more likely be the main audience of any Super League.
While the ESL was a disaster of an idea with even worse PR, the idea of 'fans of the future' was not too wide of the mark.
In every town and city up and down the United Kingdom and Ireland, you will see younger football fans wearing jerseys of Europe's elite clubs, just as easily as they might wear one of the team whose stadium they can see from their school playground.
A common sight are kids in 'Messi 10' Barcelona shirts, which will no doubt be replaced by  this season's Paris Saint-Germain equivalent as young fans support the greatest player of all time wherever he plays. 
That interest is also likely to be shared by many 'legacy fans' who will be more likely to watch Ligue 1 this season despite having no vested interest in the competition.
Football fans love their clubs first and foremost, but also want to see entertaining matches and  what will be more entertaining than a front three of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe? 
Messi's exit is a blow for La Liga, especially for the neutral fan, but Barcelona and Real Madrid will continue to draw viewers to the Spanish top flight, even without the Argentine legend.
   
La Liga coped with the loss of Cristiano Ronaldo  and will cope with Messi's exit too, while  Serie A became more popular thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo. 
Even without either of the two best players in the world, the Premier League remains the world's most popular division.
This summer, it added some more exciting talent, including Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund, but thankfully for the Bundesliga, BVB were able to stop Erling Haaland from leaving for England too.
In a summer of flux, the German top flight needs Haaland now more than ever, especially if it is to add some 'fans of the future' of its own.
Robert Lewandowski is the league's best player and the world's best striker, but does not have the same X-Factor as Haaland when it comes to exciting younger fans.
The Pole is seen as efficient on the pitch and although his social media presence is charming and entertaining, he turns 33 this month and is seen to be coming towards the end of his career.
21 TODAY 🎂The crown prince of world football 🤴Erling Haaland has already achieved so much 🌟But what's next? 🤔  pic.twitter.com/HZJqx7wBPN 
Haaland has just turned 21 and already has taken the football world – and Instagram – by storm.
He will continue to get better and next summer's release clause ensures that every major club will be chasing his signature.
For now, he remains, and Dortmund and will be the Bundesliga's biggest draw, their most marketable player and the superstar they need to compete for viewership with the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A and now Ligue 1.
Haaland kicked off the 2021-22 season with a hat-trick in Dortmund's German Cup win over Wehen Wiesbaden to take his scoring tally to 60 goals in 60 games in all competitions.
He finished as the Champions League's top scorer last season and bagged two goals in the final as Dortmund lifted the German Cup.
Everywhere he has played, he has scored goals, against every level of opponent. That has drawn attention and praise from the best in the game, including Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola. 
“To score that number of goals at his age is not easy. He’s 20 years old and the numbers speak for themselves,”  Guardiola said earlier this year. 
“When that happens it’s because he can score with the right, the left, via counterattacks, in the box. He’s a fantastic striker, everyone knows it.”
He knows it, Dortmund know it and, perhaps most importantly, the Bundesliga knows it.
In a world where every league is competing for viewership and trying to win new fans, the Bundesliga needs Haaland more than ever."
"Aug 13, 2021",Koeman wants Barcelona to 'close the book' on Messi as Fati and Coutinho challenge is set,"Ronald Koeman is looking for Barcelona to ""close the book"" on Lionel Messi with Ansu Fati and Phillipe Coutinho being set the challenge of filling iconic boots at Camp Nou.
After 17 memorable years of remarkable performances from Messi, the Blaugrana are bracing themselves to open a campaign without him at their disposal.
Financial issues in Catalunya prevented fresh terms from being put in place with Messi, allowing him to depart as a free agent and link up with Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain.
Filling a Messi-shaped void will be an impossible task for Koeman, but the Dutch coach is eager to escape a shadow that will continue to loom large over his squad.
He told ESPN: ""We have to understand that there is always an end for a player. You have to close the book because now we have to focus on this new season. We have new players in and we have to move forward, and we have time for that. 
""We have young players in the squad this season, and it's also for the future, we are working on the future of this club, and it's really important to have our focus on this and not focus on what happened in the last few days.""
On seeing the six-time Ballon d'Or winner depart, Koeman said: ""I knew there was a difficult situation between the club and Leo Messi and the league to have the possibilities to keep Messi in the club.
""It takes a long time, but I was also surprised by the day and the moment that I heard that he was finished playing for Barcelona. I knew the financial situation of the club made it more difficult.
""I think it was difficult because we are not just talking about any player, we are talking about Leo Messi, the best player in the world through a lot of seasons and we were all disappointed that he will not play for us this season. 
""OK, you have to change fast because you don't stay in the disappointment with the new season starting. You have to understand it was for a few days a difficult situation. Messi meant so much for this club.""
   
Barcelona are going to need someone, potentially a group of players, to step up and help counter the absence of the South American superstar.
Koeman added: ""Of course we will have more difficulties to score goals. Messi scored 30 goals last season. So other players need to bring more and take the next step and it's more about the team now than individual players.
""It's not always one player, you have to do it together. Hopefully, we get players back from injury like Ansu Fati and Coutinho and then we still have a strong squad. We will work harder, we will do more to achieve what people expect from us.
""We are still in the transition. We have to understand that the start of this season is difficult. We still have Covid, for all the clubs, but still we have players with injuries so we cannot put all the players for playing because we are still missing good players. 
""We did a good pre-season, we have young players in, but if we get all the players back from injury the squad is still a strong one.""
Barca are set to open their 2021-22 Liga campaign at home to Real Sociedad on Sunday.

"Aug 12, 2021",Messi's historic PSG deal includes crypto fan tokens as Ligue 1 giants fund stunning signing,"Lionel Messi's historic contract at Paris Saint-Germain has seen the Argentine given a number of ""fan tokens"", with Ligue 1 giants using cryptocurrency to partly fund a stunning deal.
A six-time Ballon d'Or winner has bid an emotional farewell to Barcelona, with financial issues at Camp Nou preventing the Argentine from committing to the only club side he has represented at senior level.
The Blaugrana's loss has been PSG's gain, with an ambitious and big-spending outfit in the French capital pulling off a remarkable coup as they add an all-time great to an already star-studded squad.
Messi has been handed a lucrative two-year contract at Parc des Princes, with PSG stating on the club's official website on how they have put that deal in place: ""In a world first for such a high-profile signing, Leo Messi received a large number of ‘$PSG Fan Tokens’.
""The inclusion of the $PSG Fan Tokens in the player’s welcome package instantly ties him with millions of Paris Saint-Germain fans around the world. The move further positions Paris Saint-Germain as one of the most innovative and avant-garde sports franchises in the world.
""Token implementation comes as a great illustration of the way the club is constantly finding ways to increase and diversify its revenue streams to continue developing as a global brand.
""In 2018, Paris Saint-Germain made a pioneering step into the world of blockchain, becoming the first sports franchise to partner with Socios.com. Since then, Paris Saint-Germain and Socios.com have been working side by side to capitalize on this new and unique way to connect the club with the fans, and the best is yet to come. For millions of PSG supporters around the world, Fan Tokens have become a creative way to engage with the rouge & bleu.
""Paris Saint-Germain fans have been very active on Socios.com, taking advantage of a host of engagement opportunities on the app. Through $PSG Fan Tokens, fans worldwide get the opportunity to choose a motivational message on the wall of the dressing room before a key game, the goal of the geason, or the winners of the club’s end of season awards. Fans have also experienced unique, personal video calls from first team stars via the platform, and even more exciting activations are planned for the coming weeks and months.
""The hype surrounding the latest signings in the club’s busy summer transfer window created a huge surge of interest in $PSG Fan Tokens, with trading volumes exceeding $1.2 billion in the days preceding the move.""
   
Mauricio Pochettino's side have added Messi, Sergio Ramos, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Georginio Wijnaldum and Achraf Hakimi to their ranks this summer.
They have, however, only had to pay a fee for the last entry on that list, with four proven international performers acquired as free agents.
That is helping them to adhere to Financial Fair Play regulations, with the club also making the most of other opportunities - such as cryptocurrency - in order to strengthen without breaching UEFA-imposed rules on spending.
Marc Armstrong, chief partnerships officer at PSG, has said of the deal for Messi: ""Fully embracing Socios.com and $PSG Fan Tokens has proved a massive success for the Club. We have been able to engage with a new global audience, creating a significant digital revenue stream.""
Alexandre Dreyfus, CEO of Chiliz and Socios.com, added: ""Paris Saint-Germain are reaping the rewards of their bold approach and I believe this could be the start of a new trend as Fan Tokens and Socios.com play an increasingly prominent role across sport at the very highest level.""

"Aug 16, 2021",'Balance is most important' - Henry sends warning to Messi and PSG,"Thierry Henry has sent a warning to Lionel Messi and Paris Saint-Germain, insisting ""balance is most important"" as they bid to become the top team in world football.
PSG added Messi to their ranks last week following his surprise exit from Barcelona, with the Argentine committing to a two-year deal at Parc des Princes after seeing his 21-year career at Camp Nou come to a premature end.
Messi has joined Gianluigi Donnarumma, Georginio Wijnaldum and Sergio Ramos in signing for the French club on a free transfer, while Achraf Hakimi has also been brought in from Inter, but Henry is adamant that big-money additions won't guarantee the club success in 2021-22.
Henry, who played alongside Messi at Barca between 2007 and 2010, expressed doubts over PSG's defensive credentials following their 4-2 victory over Strasbourg on Saturday.
""Balance is the most important. At one point, we always talk about great players, attacking, going forward, but we need a balance,"" the former Blaugrana and France forward told Dimanche Soir Foot.
""We are talking about the team in which I played at Barca, but people forget to point out that we weren't conceding a lot of goals.
""In general, teams that don't concede a lot of goals are not far from the title, or even from the Champions League.
""When you have superhuman players, it gets a little easier but when I see how Paris is evolving at the moment, they concede too many goals for my taste to be able to go a little further. It is true that there was a lack of players but the balance is the most important.""
PSG will be confident of wrestling the Ligue 1 title back from Lille after the arrival of Messi, but their main goal for the season is to win the Champions League for the first time in their history.
The Argentina international opened up on his Champions League ambitions after being unveiled at Parc des Princes, telling reporters: ""For me on a personal level, I would love to win another Champions League, like I've said in previous years, and I think I've come to the ideal place that's ready for that.""

"Aug 14, 2021",Messi to PSG: A transfer 10 years in the making and completed in a matter of days,"Lionel Messi to Paris Saint-Germain was a transfer 10 years in the making but was ultimately completed in a matter of days.
Presented with the unique opportunity to sign a player that they have long coveted, PSG moved with the ruthless efficiency that they have become known for in the market to complete the signing of the the Barcelona icon, a player who many thought would never play for another European club.
‘Dream Bigger’ is the slogan of PSG. When they completed a world record €222 million ($262m/£189m) move to sign Neymar in the summer of 2017 in a deal that forever changed the footballing landscape, it barely seemed possible that they might achieve a more sensational coup. 
Yet four years on they have in their ranks arguably the greatest player that the game has ever seen. PSG’s Qatari owners, QSI, certainly think so.
When QSI took over PSG in the summer of 2011, their ambition was to make the Parc des Princes club one of Europe’s flagship teams. While the club’s detractors argue this is a side with no history, they forget that PSG were, by the measure of UEFA’s coefficient at least, the continent’s finest side in the mid-1990s, boasting talent such as David Ginola and George Weah.
It is true, though, by the time that QSI took over that they were down on their luck. Indeed, just a handful of seasons earlier, they had won a final-day match in Sochaux to avoid relegation to Ligue 2.
Amid such a backdrop, it seemed fanciful that PSG could be transformed into a club that a player the stature of Messi might consider joining. And yet, from the outset, QSI targeted both the Argentine and his long-time rival Cristiano Ronaldo as benchmark signings as they set out to make the Parisians European champions.
Paris, as one of the world’s most recognisable cities and a hotbed of footballing talent, they reckoned, was ripe to be exploited as a venue for an elite side. The raw materials – including the iconic status, an urban population of more than two million and, yes, a footballing history - were present.
QSI brought their marketing savvy and, crucially, the catalyst of money. An awful lot of money.
Over a decade they have built a club worthy of the game’s greatest players, all the while keeping tabs on the actions of Messi and Ronaldo, until last summer it became evident that the Argentine was unsettled and even wanted to leave Barcelona.
   
Although this was shut down by erstwhile Blaugrana president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who demanded a huge transfer fee for the player - Messi wrongly believed he had a clause in his contract that allowed him to depart for free - the door had been opened as the Argentine entered the final year of a bumper deal with the Catalans.
PSG tried to prise it open with a public charm offensive led by several of Messi’s friends in the Parc des Princes club’s ranks. Neymar, Angel Di Maria, Marco Verratti and Leandro Paredes were among those who sought to plant a seed in the mind of ‘La Pulga’.
Speaking in December 2020, just before PSG could have opened formal discussions with the player, Paredes said: “We all want him to come. I hope Leo makes the best decision for himself, but we would welcome him here with open arms.”
Messi, though, was insistent that he would wait until the end of the season before deciding his future, with Barca unable to get close to the terms he was previously on due to their spiralling debts, which amounted to over €1.2 billion ($1.4bn/£1bn).
In the meantime, his situation at Camp Nou looked rosier. Bartomeu had tendered his resignation and Joan Laporta swept back into power as president, voted in on a ticket of being the man to keep Messi at the club.
The end of the season came, with Barca third in La Liga and dumped out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage. No deal was done. The next landmark date was June 30, the final day of Messi’s previous contract. Still no deal was done.
And even after Messi led Argentina to their first international title since 1993 at the Copa America, still no deal was done.
A contract was in place, barring a few minor details, but it would never be signed, despite the permanently public upbeat attitude of Laporta and his board.
Until the end, Barca were bullish over Messi’s future but La Liga would not make any concessions to them with regards the salary cap they needed to abide to, making it impossible for him to be registered.

Then came that fateful Thursday, August 5. It is a date that will long be written in footballing history as the one when Messi’s future at Barcelona was finally over.   
“Despite FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi having reached an agreement and the clear intention of both parties to sign a new contract today, this cannot happen because of financial and structural obstacles,” Barcelona lamented in a statement tacitly criticising La Liga’s lack of support for their plight.
“As a result of this situation, Messi shall not be staying on at FC Barcelona. Both parties deeply regret that the wishes of the player and the club will ultimately not be fulfilled.”
With the European season a matter of days away, the greatest player on the planet was leaving his home of more than two decades and needed a club. The pain told as he gave his tearful goodbye press conference at Barcelona.
“Everyone knows how hard it was for me to leave Barcelona,” Messi explained. “It’s hard to think about a change after so long.”
Yet that was the reality he found himself in.
Messi’s options were limited. Manchester City, where his long-time mentor Pep Guardiola has set up camp, had just spent big on Jack Grealish, while the only other club capable and willing to shoulder his wage demands was PSG. So his entourage contacted the club.
   
Beyond the riches that PSG possess, there were other attractions for Messi, most notably a clan of close friends at the club. Neymar, for example, had been trying to talk him into moving to France for two years following the pair’s close relationship at Barcelona.
Di Maria is another good friend, and along with Paredes and Verratti. It is not unusual to see the group pictured together on social media during their downtime. Three such examples hinted towards this outcome.
During the Copa America, Messi shared an image of himself in an ice bath flanked by Paredes and Di Maria, then after the tournament had been won, he was pictured joking with Neymar in an apparently intimate manner.
Finally, on August 4, mere hours before his Barcelona career was finally over, he appeared on Di Maria’s Instagram feed pictured in Ibiza alongside that familiar quartet of stars in an image that could now pass as a PSG squad photo. All parties insist, however, that there is no correlation between this picture and what transpired.
Speaking at his press conference, Messi said: “They were saying: ‘Come to Paris, come to Paris’, but it's a total coincidence that the photo was taken with the PSG players in Ibiza in the same week as all of this.”
This version of events is corroborated by Di Maria, who told ESPN: “Leo has said it already, it was just coincidence. We were going there with him and Paredes. Then Neymar came and invited us, and Verratti joined us. Leo was being told to come to PSG, but everything was set for him at Barca. He told us he was going to stay there.”
Messi’s world was turned upside down 24 hours later and, having received contact from his entourage, PSG sprang into action.
Having followed the player for the best part of a decade, this was an unexpected opportunity. He had been sounded out on occasion before, but it was only after Barcelona’s announcement last Thursday that a deal became viable.
Neymar was a cheerleader for PSG in the deal, texting and calling his friend, urging him to reach an agreement.
   
Internally, meanwhile, serious discussions were taking place over the viability of signing him. In particular, the financial department worked on the dossier with regards to Financial Fair Play as the club had already captured Achraf Hakimi, Georginio Wijnaldum, Sergio Ramos and Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer.
Even if PSG only paid a fee for Hakimi, all command huge wages.
PSG concluded that the Messi deal could be given the green light, although they have committed to making €180m ($212m/£153m) worth of player sales this summer - a major challenge in a stagnant transfer market. Nevertheless, as far as PSG were concerned, that was a problem for another time.
Things picked up pace from there. An agreement was quickly reached with Messi over a two-year deal, including the possibility of an additional season. Even somewhat complicated issues were resolved relatively speedily.
By Saturday, an agreement in principle had been reached and PSG purred into gear, with the marketing department particularly active in devising a strategy to maximise reach.
The following day, the momentum of the deal seemed to stall as fans gathered outside La Bourget Airport to welcome him to Paris. Only there was no Messi; he was pictured back home in Barcelona relaxing.

While far-fetched rumours of a move elsewhere appeared and disappeared just as quickly, Messi’s lawyers were going over the contract details in fine detail.
It was on the morning of August 10 that the formal offer that Messi would accept was presented to him. By this stage the deal was an open secret; the player had already appeared at the window of his hotel bedecked in a club T-shirt.
Hours later, the impossible had happened. Messi was pictured holding a PSG shirt inside Parc des Princes, having formally signed to join the club, marking both the greatest crossroads in his career and also in the history of France’s strongest club.
On Saturday, Messi and the club's other summer signings will be presented to the PSG fans ahead of their first Ligue 1 match of the season against Strasbourg. For those lucky supporters present, it will scarcely be possible to Dream Bigger."
"Aug 12, 2021",Messi and Ramos: From bitter rivals at Barcelona and Real Madrid to PSG team-mates,"Barcelona and Real Madrid’s biggest icons, Lionel Messi and Sergio Ramos, warred for well over a decade at the peak of Spanish football, but now have been brought together as team-mates at Paris Saint-Germain.
From brutal tackles, verbal barrages and thrilling one-on-one battles, Ramos and Messi’s rivalry made sparks fly in countless Clasicos, but now the duo must quickly consign their differences to history and pull in the same direction.
Thursday marked Lionel Messi's first day of PSG training and the sight of the ex-Madrid and Barca captains in a warm embrace will take some getting used to. 
The first time they notably clashed was in 2010, when frustration got the better of Ramos, as Messi’s incredible performance in Barcelona’s 5-0 win over Real Madrid drove him to boiling point.
With the Argentine still ghosting past Madrid defenders in stoppage time, Ramos reached the end of his tether and scythed down Messi from behind, sending the forward crashing to the Camp Nou turf.
“Terrible kick by Ramos; a terrible blow,” muttered the commentators, disapprovingly, as the Madrid man was dismissed.
Ramos shoved Carles Puyol in the face, and followed it up with another palm in the direction of Xavi Hernandez for good measure, as he stormed off the pitch under the dead-eyed stare of then-coach Jose Mourinho. 
Mourinho had accused Messi of theatrics ahead of the clash, and the Argentine put on a show for him, despite not scoring for the first time in 10 Clasicos.

Barcelona’s playmaker dropped deep into midfield from his false nine role, controlling the game, not allowing Ramos to get near him without being dragged out of position.
Overall, the Messi era was not a kind period for Real Madrid, in domestic terms, with Los Blancos winning three leagues since 2009, in contrast to Barcelona’s eight.
That meant Ramos vs Messi confrontations more often ended up in favour of the latter, with the Barcelona striker’s 18 goals a record in the Clasico.
However, without Ramos on the pitch doing his best to shackle the Argentine – and, in recent seasons, he edged this battle, with Messi not netting against Real Madrid since 2018  – the diminutive No.10 was able to do a lot more damage.
Ramos, remember, was sent off for a wild, two-footed, studs-up lunge at Messi in 2017 at the Santiago Bernabeu and that game ended 3-2 in Barcelona's favour, with Messi iconically raising his shirt to the stands after netting a last-minute winner.
   
However, Ramos had the last laugh that season, with Madrid lifting the title, and it was when the World Cup winner could keep Messi at bay, that Madrid enjoyed Clasico success. 
In Los Blancos’ last seven Clasico wins, dating back to 2012, Messi only scored once. And in that match, Madrid’s 2-1 La Liga win in March 2013, it was Ramos who grabbed the winner. 
The Andalusian headed home from a corner in the 82nd minute, atoning for failing to stop Messi’s earlier equaliser, when he might have blocked the forward's path to goal.
Perhaps their most furious encounter came in 2019, though, when Ramos swung an arm at Messi during a challenge. 
Although the defender didn’t make clean contact with his opponent, Messi was enraged and the pair butted heads.
Over the years, there have been plenty of flashpoints between the two, some going unpunished by the officials and now lost in the mists of time. 
But whatever unseemly business happened on the pitch between Messi and Ramos tended to stay on the pitch. 

A post shared by Sergio Ramos (@sergioramos)
Ramos revealed he has always regarded Messi as one of the best in the world. 
""I have huge respect for him,"" he told La Liga in 2020. ""I think he’s one of the greatest players in history and I have huge respect for him.” 
In recent months, Ramos made jovial overtures to Messi, to persuade him to join him at Real Madrid, back when he still thought he would be staying there this season.
""He could stay at mine for the first week or so,” said Ramos on the streaming platform Twitch in March. ""He can find his feet and get comfy, I'd be more than happy to do that.”
However, Ramos saw his contract renewal offer withdrawn by Real Madrid and wound up in the French capital, with Messi joining him there this week, allowing the Spaniard to finally get his wish.
“Who’d have thought it, right, Leo?” said Ramos on Instagram, posting a photo of his PSG shirt next to Messi’s. 
Instead of facing off, they stand side by side, with the same goal – winning the Champions League again."
"Aug 14, 2021",When is Messi's PSG debut? Dates for Argentine star's first game with his new club,"Lionel Messi is now officially a Paris Saint-Germain player.
Seeing him in non-Blaugrana colours might take a little while to get used to, after the Argentina star joined the Ligue 1 side following a breakdown in contract negotiations with Barcelona.
Attention has now turned to when Messi will make his debut with PSG, and Goal has all the information you need.
Messi will most likely don the PSG kit for the first time on August 29 against Reims, or at home at the Parc des Princes on September 12 against Clermont Foot.
While the Ligue 1 season has already begun, and Messi has already been pictured in PSG training, the Argentine might not make his official Ligue 1 debut for the club for several weeks.
The attacker has spent a number of weeks off on holiday after lifting the Copa America with Argentina, and since he only signed for the French side on August 10, PSG's August 14 game against Strasbourg came too soon as he continues his own mini-preseason.
The fixture against Brest on August 20 might also be deemed too early, as Messi still needs to return to full match fitness.
“I don't know when my debut will be,"" Messi said at the time of his signing.
""I have just returned from vacation, I have been rested for a month. Honestly I don't know when I'll be back. I met the coach and the staff yesterday. I will probably have to do some preparation, start training and when I'm ready I'll start playing. 
""I will see depending on the preparation, the training, my feelings, but when the staff find me ready, I will start with a lot of desire.""
AS however suggest Messi's debut could be pushed until September 12 specifically so that he will make his first appearance in front of a full crowd at the home stadium.
The PSG coach said: ""Today was Leo's second training session, a month after the Copa final. The idea is to see how he feels so he can make his debut.
""Everyone has seen it, the last few days Leo has had an amazing reception. He is a special boy and we are a staff that listens to the players and we are going to talk to him to find out what he needs and when he will be ready.
""I have always enjoyed him. Everyone knows the rivalry between Espanyol and Barca, but I have always enjoyed him. He is happy. We can feel it. He's mature. We have a common background with the Newell's Old Boys.""

"Aug 13, 2021","'Messi is a nightmare, it is better not to play against him!’ - David Luiz explains Ligue 1 snub and Arsenal exit","David Luiz remains a free agent after leaving Arsenal, with the Brazilian defender admitting to snubbing interest from Ligue 1 because ""Lionel Messi is a nightmare"" and it is ""better not to play against him"".
A six-time Ballon d'Or winner has made his way to France this summer, with an all-time great linking up with Paris Saint-Germain after seeing an iconic spell at Barcelona brought to a close.
Luiz has previously spent time at Parc des Princes, but he is in no rush to face them in 2021-22 and will continue to wait on enticing offers before committing to the next chapter in his career.
Quizzed by the Daily Mail on his decision not to head back to Ligue 1, Luiz has said: ""Messi is a nightmare, it is better not to play against him!""
An experienced 34-year-old centre-half finds himself without a club as new seasons open up around the world.
He had spent the last two years with Arsenal, taking in 73 appearances, but it was revealed in May that he would not be signing a new contract.
Luiz claims that decision was partly driven by his own ambition, with the enigmatic South American suggesting that plans in north London do not match his own.
He added: ""Both of us decided to split.
""I came for two years and the aim was to win something, which I did (the FA Cup and Community Shield).
""Now, I think the club has a different project for the long term. They have different ideas. My idea is to win, win, win as soon as possible.""
   
While Luiz looks to find another trophy-chasing employer, he is keeping a close eye on events at former clubs.
He previously tasted Premier League and Champions League glory while with Chelsea and has seen the Blues invest heavily this summer on £98 million ($135m) frontman Romelu Lukaku.
Luiz was at Stamford Bridge when the burly Belgian striker was first signed back in 2011 and believes he will prove to be a shrewd addition the second time around.
He said of a proven performer: ""Romelu deserves this move.
""I remember the day he missed the deciding penalty against Bayern Munich in the Super Cup (in 2013) and he was so sad, just a young boy. 
""But he is not a kid now, he is a real man. I think he will prove to be amazing for Chelsea.""

"Aug 13, 2021","'Ligue 1 is not as easy as people think' - Messi's arrival doesn't guarantee PSG the title, insists Fabregas","""Ligue 1 is not as easy as people think"", according to Cesc Fabregas, who has insisted that Lionel Messi's arrival at Paris Saint-Germain does not guarantee them the title.
Messi was forced to call time on his illustrious 21-year career at Barcelona last week as the club announced that they were unable to re-sign the 34-year-old due to the current wage limit in La Liga.
PSG subsequently swooped in to sign Messi on a free transfer, completing a star-studded squad that also contains the likes of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Sergio Ramos, but Fabregas has warned that it is by no means a forgone conclusion that they will dominate the French top-flight in 2021-22.
The Monaco midfielder, who played alongside Messi at Barca between 2011 and 2014, has told The Guardian: “When PSG don’t win the league everyone sees it as a disaster because they spend a lot of money.
“Everyone takes it that this is a one-team league but in the last five years they’ve won three because Lille and Monaco have also won the title and put the brakes on their winning streak.
""It is a competitive league. It is not as easy as people think. It’s very aggressive, very intensive, very fast with strong players who defend very well.""
Fabregas went on to express his belief that PSG's main goal won't be to wrestle the Ligue 1 crown back from Lille now that Messi is on board, with a first-ever Champions League crown deemed to be more important for an ambitious outfit.
“I’m sure as a coach [Mauricio] Pochettino prefers to have a fantastic squad with a lot of pressure on himself knowing he needs to win than the other way around,"" he added. ""They must have pressure when they create a super team like that. It’s obvious they want to win the Champions League.
“They’ve been trying to catch it for a very long time and it seems like this is the last push – like, there is nothing better than Lionel Messi, there is no better defender than Ramos, [Georginio] Wijnaldum is one of the best midfielders at the moment, [Achraf] Hakimi is one of the best right-backs in Europe.
'It feels like they are doing the little extra final push to see where it takes them. We will see.""
Messi was greeted by thousands of PSG supporters at both the airport and Parc des Princes after touching down in France on Tuesday, with Fabregas of the opinion that the six-time Ballon d'Or winner is the only active player that commands such a following wherever he goes.
The ex-Barca star has suggested that Messi is oblivious to just how popular he is across the globe, while predicting that PSG's fanbase will grow exponentially now that they have the Argentine on their books.
“Sometimes I tell Leo he doesn’t know how big he is,"" said Fabregas. ""He goes to places and thinks the reaction is normal because he has been raised being the best and has been always surrounded by fans.
""But when you see it from the outside it is something I’ve not seen around anyone else. Sometimes there are more followers of Leo as a person than for a single club.
""A lot of people now will be following Ligue 1, especially with Leo there. The three of them, with Neymar and [Kylian] Mbappé there, will be fantastic to watch.”

"Aug 24, 2021",Messi included in Argentina squad for World Cup qualifiers as Icardi injury clears path for PSG debut,"Lionel Messi has been included in Argentina's squad for their upcoming World Cup qualifiers despite being yet to make his debut for Paris Saint-Germain.
Messi hasn't seen a single minute of competitive action since helping Argentina beat Brazil in the Copa America final on July 11, but has still been making plenty of headlines due to a surprise change of location at club level.
The 34-year-old was forced to bring his 21-year career at Barcelona to an end last month due to the club's ongoing financial struggles, and he subsequently joined PSG on a free transfer, but supporters are still waiting to see the six-time Ballon d'Or winner make his first appearance.
Messi was unavailable for PSG's first three Ligue 1 games of the 2021-22 campaign, but has been training with the rest of the squad as he continues to build up his fitness following his summer holidays.
Head coach Mauricio Pochettino has said that the Argentine could be handed  his maiden outing for the club away at Reims on Sunday, which marks their last fixture before the international break comes into effect.
A path has been cleared for Messi to figure in that contest, with fellow countryman Mauro Icardi picking up a shoulder injury that is set to keep him out for up to a month.
PSG have said in a statement on the club's official website: ""Medical examinations have revealed the Argentina international is suffering from a Grade 2 sprain of the acromioclavicular joint.
""It is estimated he will return to full training in three to four weeks.""
Despite the fact that Messi is still getting back up to speed physically, Argentina boss Lionel Scaloni has called up the ex-Barcelona superstar for his side's latest set of World Cup qualifiers in September.
If Messi does indeed join up with his country for their games against Venezuela, Brazil and Bolivia, he could be a major doubt for PSG's next set of matches later in the month due to the fact that Argentina and Brazil are still on the 'red list' for travellers under the French government's current coronavirus rules.

PSG could also be sweating on the availability of Angel Di Maria and Leandro Paredes, who have been called up alongside Messi as Argentina seek to move one step closer to Qatar 2022.
Elsewhere, Juventus talisman Paulo Dybala has returned to the international fold after a two-year absence, with Aston Villa duo Emiliano Martinez and Emiliano Buendia also included.

"Aug 23, 2021",Romero claims Messi wanted him at Barcelona before PSG and Tottenham deals,"Tottenham new boy Cristian Romero claims Lionel Messi wanted to put a deal in place that would have taken him to Barcelona before the summer transfer window shifted significantly.
The six-time Ballon d'Or winner was expected to sign a new contract at Camp Nou, allowing him to remain in La Liga alongside a number of fresh faces such as Sergio Aguero, Memphis Depay and Eric Garcia.
Messi however walked away as a free agent and signed with Paris Saint-Germain, while Romero - who tasted Copa America glory alongside his illustrious team-mate - is now in north London following a €50 million (£42m/$59m) move from Atalanta.
Romero claims he could have headed in a different direction if Messi had got his way, telling Radio AM 550: ""The fact that Messi would want me in his team, and that he wanted me to come to Barcelona is amazing.
""The team that PSG have built is crazy. I'm a bit sad about how Leo left Barcelona, I thought he would have stayed there forever. I wish him all the best, he's a great person and hopefully he can win everything alongside the other Argentinians there.""
Romero has made impressive progress over recent years having been forced to leave Juventus in search of regular game time.
He made a senior international debut for Argentina in June and is now a continental champion, with Messi and co welcoming him into a star-studded fold.
The 23-year-old added: ""I'm thankful to Messi and for everything that I shared with him and the rest of the national team. From the first day the group made me feel like I'd been there for years. That's just the kind of group it is there.""

"Aug 14, 2021",'Ronaldo would be dying to be here' - Di Maria says Messi deal is 'much better' for PSG,"Paris Saint-Germain winger Angel Di Maria claims ""Cristiano Ronaldo would be dying to be here"", with the Portuguese superstar among those watching from afar as the Ligue 1 giants pulled off the considerable coup of signing Lionel Messi.
One all-time great has arrived in the French capital, with six-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi committing to a two-year deal at Parc des Princes after seeing Barcelona fail to agree a new contract amid serious financial difficulties at Camp Nou.
PSG had previously been linked with Ronaldo as he enters the final year of his terms at Juventus, but the iconic 36-year-old has, for now, missed out on the chance to join forces with his on-field rival.
Argentina forward Di Maria, who has played alongside both legendary performers on domestic and international stages, told TyC Sports: ""Cristiano Ronaldo would be dying to be here. The quality and quantity of players at PSG is something unique.
""It doesn’t happen often in clubs and the greats always want to be with the best. Cristiano would certainly like to be here, but they signed Messi and luckily, it’s better this way.""
Di Maria, who worked with Ronaldo at Real Madrid, added on his fellow countryman who has joined him in France: ""Messi is of another category. You throw a stone at him and he stops it, he does it as if it was nothing. He thinks before the others.
""I have never seen anything like it. I have played with Cristiano, Neymar, [Kylian] Mbappe, [Wayne] Rooney, [Robin] van Persie, [Zlatan] Ibrahimovic, [Karim] Benzema, [Gareth] Bale and honestly, I have never seen anything like it.
""Leo is something unique. For me, it’s very easy to play with him. If you run, he gives you the ball at your feet. There are no excuses. I have a very good relationship with him, even off the pitch.
""I think Messi will feel better here than in Catalunya. With the welcome he has had in Paris, I think he already understands what he represents.""
   
Few could have predicted that Messi would sever ties with the only club side that he represented at senior level.
One man that expected him to remain at Camp Nou was Sergio Aguero, with the Argentina international striker leaving Manchester City as a free agent to head for Spain.
He has now seen Messi depart, while also picking up an untimely injury, and Di Maria admits the 33-year-old will be kicking himself.
He added: ""Kun wants to kill himself, what can you do? Apart from all that [Messi leaving], the worst thing is that he got injured again and will be out for several weeks. That's the saddest thing.""
